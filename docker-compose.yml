# Docker Compose for local development and CI integration tests.
#
# Real-world usage:
# - Developers can run `docker-compose up --build` to bring up an app
#   container and a seeded MySQL instance for manual testing and demos.
# - CI workflows may use a similar service layout to run integration
#   tests against a predictable environment.
